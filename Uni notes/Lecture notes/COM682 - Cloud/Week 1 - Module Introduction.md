## Main Points
- History of Cloud Computing: How we got here
- The industry is trending towards cloud for a variety of reasons: IOT, WFH, Cost, Scalibility...
- Five major paradigm shifts over the last 70 years:

50s/60s | 80s | 90s | 00s | 10s
-----|-----|-----|-----|-----
Mainframes | Client/Server | Hypertext and Web | Server Oriented Architecture | Cloud and Edge Computing

- Some interesting historical points:
	- 1950: Herb Grosch postulated that the entire world would operate on dumb terminals powered by about 15 large data centers.
	- 1960: John McCarthy opined that “computation may someday be organised as a public utility”
	- 1966: Douglas Parkhill describes modern cloud computing.
	- 1968: Douglas Englebert presents the mother of all demos - demonstrated for the first time many of the fundamental elements of modern personal computing: windows, hypertext, graphics, efficient navigation and command input, video conferencing, the computer mouse, word processing, dynamic file linking, revision control, and a collaborative real-time editor.
	- 1969: ARPANET developed (Predecessor of the internet)
	- 1974-1985: TCP/IP, UDP, DNS
	- 1989: HTTP protocol
	- 1993: Server-side scripting
	- 1998: The first Google server built in a lego case
	- 2006: AWS is opened after Amazon develops EC2 and S3 (Cloud-based servers and storage)

- In addition to infrastructure, a common protocol is needed for communication in cloud computing e.g. MS Remote Procedure Calls (RPC), Java RMI, CORBA
- Cloud operates on a 3-tiered architecture: Web browser (Client), Application server, Database. These are referred to as the presentation layer, logic layer and data layer respectively.
- These are scaled on the cloud using load balancing and servers:

  Cloud native solutions:
	- Technologies to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments

Platform-agnostic technologies: JSON, REST, SOAP...
