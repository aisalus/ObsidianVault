## Features
- Desktop application for storing user passwords
- Can generate secure passwords and store them as needed
- Authentication required to access the app
- Passwords are encrypted and stored appropriately
- Passwords only stored on the host machine
  
## Technologies
- C# (.NET using WPF)
- Appropriate C# libraries (eg Cryptography)
- Database for storage

## Potential issues
- Not enough knowledge of encryption etc - need to do more reading

## Overall thoughts
- More research needed on cryptography and best practices
- Use case: A client based desktop password manager which can generate and store secure passwords.
- Existing solutions: KeePass - a free open source password manager. 
- What I'd do differently: A better UI - more straightforward as the KeePass UI is very complex for non-technical users
